        <h1>Game of Life</h1>
        <p class="intro">
            A recreation of John Conway's Game of Life (Also known
            simply as life). It is a zero-player game that involves
            creating an initial state and observing the evolution
            according to a simple set of rules: <br>
            <br>1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
            <br>2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
            <br>3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly,
            all other dead cells stay dead.

        <p class="basics">
            To play the game simply select the squares to make them 'alive'
            and hit the 'Next' button to proceed to the next generation.
            The 'Start' button will automatically iterate through generations
            until the button is pressed again. To reset the board, hit the
            reset button.
        </p>
        <p class="game-state">
            To view information regarding the state of the game, press either
            the Neighbours or Colours Button. The Neighbours button will display
            the number of alive cells surrounding any individual cell. The Colours
            button will colour code which cells will live and die in the next generation.
